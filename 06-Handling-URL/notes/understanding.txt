protocol -> set of rules which tell browser how to comm with the browser https (s-> means secure)
Domain -> human freindly name which actually points to some IP using Ip everywhere is not possible not human freindly
Quer-Parameter we can have N number of parameter
--spaces not allowed in URL

Http module ->
1761918017821 : /about?myname=adityaNew Req Recived
cannot parse this
go to npm.jsx
for that we need install package name url for that

if some thing like ->
      "dependencies": {
        "url": "^0.11.4"
      }

now if you delete node module folder then just npm install will do the work since have it in your dependencies 
const url = require("url"); - > search flow - > node module or in your package tif not then in built in module

const myurl = url.parse(req.url,true); // true for parsig query string

Url {
  protocol: null,
  slashes: null,
  auth: null,
  host: null,
  port: null,
  hostname: null,
  hash: null,
  search: '?myname=aditya&uid=1',
  query: [Object: null prototype] { myname: 'aditya', uid: '1' },
  pathname: '/about',
  path: '/about?myname=aditya&uid=1',
  href: '/about?myname=aditya&uid=1'
}
